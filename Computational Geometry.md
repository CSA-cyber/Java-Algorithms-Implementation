## 15.1 Basics

•	The great-circle distance or orthodromic distance is the shortest distance between any two points on the surface of a sphere measured along a path on the surface of the sphere (as opposed to going through the sphere's interior).

•	The constant PI (π) is the ratio of any circle’s circumference to its diameter.

•	Diameter = the maximum distance between two points on the periphery of the circle

•	Perimeter is the distance around a two-dimensional shape, or the measurement of the distance around something; the length of the boundary.
